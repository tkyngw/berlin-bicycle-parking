                <h1>What is this project about?</h1>
                <p> In Berlin, more than 28,000 parking stands were installed at S- and U-Bahn stations in 2014. Every year about 1,000 new bike + ride parking lots are built. Current number is thus about 30,000. The up-and-coming Referendum calls, among other things, 100,000 new bicycle parking spaces on S- and U-Bahn stations by 2020. </p>
